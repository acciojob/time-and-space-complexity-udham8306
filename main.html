    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity, meaning it performs well even with large inputs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with <b>O(n)</b> space complexity means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
